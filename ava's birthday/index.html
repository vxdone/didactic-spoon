 <h1> happy birthday ava ! </h1>
<h4>i hope your day is going well and your wishes come true. how's it like being 14 now? do you feel any different or the same? becoming 14 didn't really seem to affect me at all, but it did make me realize we're going to be in high school in one year :') sorry, didn't mean to mention high school. it's just that time goes by so fast... soon we'll be like 50 before we know it. nevertheless, enjoy your birthday and eat lots of cake. make sure to tell me later how it goes! </h4>
